# Genetic Algorithm for Image Pattern Optimization

This Python script uses a genetic algorithm to optimize the generation of image patterns. The goal is to evolve a set of patterns that, when combined, closely resemble a target image.

## Features

* **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Employs a genetic algorithm to evolve image patterns.
* **Image Reconstruction**: Aims to reconstruct a target image using evolved patterns.
* **Pattern Representation**: Represents image patterns as binary matrices.
* **Fitness Evaluation**: Evaluates the fitness of pattern sets based on how well they reconstruct the target image.
* **Genetic Operators**: Uses crossover and mutation operators to evolve the pattern population.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Includes mechanisms for tuning hyperparameters like population size and mutation rate.
* **Visualization**: Provides visualization of the evolved patterns and the optimization process.
